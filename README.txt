Hello!

So if you've gotten to this website, then you probably either know or are curious about PandaView.
PandaView is a 2-D framework for games programmed in Java.  The project  started with John Kalafut, whom I personally refer to as Panda, being all, "I NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE AWESOME!".  And so here I am, because lets be honest here, I'm pretty awesome.
Regardless, this is the website for PandaView.  

At this point it is just starting to be developed and is mainly just for showoff until PandaView has made some amazing headway.
This website is pushed to a server hosted using Windows Azure from a Github repository.  So if you really want to hack us, theres a good amount of info right there.
